Noisy Clock uses the number reels from old pinball machines, the FDRV-04S Motor/Solenoid Driver, and the MOD1005 RTC and Temp Sensor to display the time. Also shows the current temperature. It's noisy.

Lightning Detector Display uses the Nokia5110 LCD and the MOD1016 Lightning Detector to display current sensor readings.

Currently working on implementing an Arduino-compatible CoAP protocol that can also run on the ESP8266.
