Noisy Clock uses the number reels from old pinball machines, the FDRV-04S Motor/Solenoid Driver, and the MOD1005 RTC and Temp Sensor to display the time. Also shows the current temperature. It's noisy.

Lightning Detector Display uses the Nokia5110 LCD and the MOD1016 Lightning Detector to display current sensor readings.

CoAP implementation, targetting the ESP8266, has been moved to Embedded Adventures' Github.
